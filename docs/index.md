## School Completion Estimates

As Sustainable Development Goal 4 shifts its focus towards school completion and learning outcomes, timely and reliable estimates of school completion rates are of utmost importance. The Technical Cooperation Group on the Indicators for SDG 4 - Education 2030 (TCG) has thus defined Indicator 4.1.2: Completion Rate as the "percentage of a cohort of children or young people aged 3-5 years above the intended age for the last grade of each level of education who have completed that grade" and approved the development of a model based estimation framework.

The latest estimates based on the research of the Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report team and produced by the Adjusted Bayesian Completion Rate (ABC) model are presented here for exploration.
